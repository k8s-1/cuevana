* Find a way to... [50%]
- [X] inject environment-specific
  variables
  ::: possible with -t TAG and
  @if(TAG) in .cue file
  
- [X] template a configuration
  ::: possible with having a #Definition and union (&) with
  regularly defined values inside other package e.g. values
  package -> see ./templates/deployment.cue
  
- [X] use values from an env-specific
  package to handle this config dynamically
  ::: solved by above
  
- [ ] be able to configure an app to only
  be included in a specific environment
  e.g. metallb on baremetal clusters

- [ ] create multiple files
  from a single .cue
  
- [ ] store these files in
  an appropriate path
